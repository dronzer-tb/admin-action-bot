- ⚙️ **Customizable** - Configure commands for your specific server setup

## Supported Moderation Actions

- Kill - Remove a player instantly
- Kick - Disconnect a player with optional reason
- Temp Ban - Temporarily ban for specified duration
- IP Ban - Permanently ban by IP address
- Mute - Prevent chat messages
- Warn - Issue formal warnings

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Linux VPS or local machine
- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip3 package manager
- Discord bot token ([Create one here](https://discord.com/developers/applications))
- Pterodactyl panel access with API key

### Installation

1. **Clone or download the repository**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/admin-action-bot
   ```

2. **Run the automated setup script**
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ./setup.sh
   ```

3. **Follow the interactive prompts** to configure:
   - Discord Bot Token
   - Discord Server ID
   - **Bot Commands Channel ID** (where admins use /admin)
   - **Audit Log Channel ID** (where actions are logged)
   - Pterodactyl API credentials
   - Custom command mappings

4. **Start the bot**
   ```bash
   # Manually
   source venv/bin/activate
   python3 main.py
   
   # Or via systemd (if configured during setup)
   sudo systemctl start admin-action-bot
   sudo systemctl status admin-action-bot
   ```

### Discord Bot Setup

1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Create a new application
3. Go to "Bot" section and create a bot
4. Enable these Privileged Gateway Intents:
   - Server Members Intent
   - Message Content Intent
5. Copy the bot token
6. Go to OAuth2 → URL Generator
7. Select scopes: `bot`, `applications.commands`
8. Select permissions:
   - Send Messages
   - Embed Links
   - Use Application Commands
   - Read Message History
9. Use the generated URL to invite the bot to your server

### Usage

In your Discord server, use the `/admin` command **in the designated bot channel** to open the admin panel. Select an action button to begin the moderation workflow.

**Important:** The `/admin` command only works in the channel you configured during setup. This keeps your server organized and prevents command spam in other channels.

**Note**: Currently, action buttons show "not yet implemented" messages. Full functionality will be added in version 0.3.0.
